            The internet enables people to communicate and connect with other people across the globe. People can do many amazing things with the internet such as emailing people from one country to another, reading what is going on in the world, people can even purchase desired items with the internet. However, how did the internet come to be? Who made it? To start off, the man who first envisioned the internet was a psychologist by the name of JCR Licklider in the 1950s. He believed that people would communicate more efficiently if all the computers were connected and this would make sharing information easier.

            Computers in the 1960s were portrayed as sci-fi props because nobody believed they would be advanced. A giant network of computers were very imaginative even for Hollywood’s standards. The first computers were very large and expensive and were never intended to communicate with one another. The reason why it received a small amount of popularity for a bit was because the United States was afraid of the Soviet’s technological superiority. The Soviets launched sputnik into space and in response, America created a program called ARPA, Advanced Research Projects Agency. This program was in charge of the space program and included computer science. However, computer science fell off when NASA, another space program, came along. The main goal for the U.S. was to beat the Soviets to space.

            Leonard Kleinrock, an MIT computer scientist, applied queuing theory to data transmission. Queuing is a tool that evaluates computer and communication systems. In Kleinrock’s words, a queue is simply a system in which it “arrives, hangs around, and leaves.” He showed how packages of data would queue at nodes as they transmitted through. This marked a revolutionary departure from the telephone systems use of circuit switching. Circuit switching is when the switching system that connects you with the other telephone creates a circuit between two phones. This was flawed because if the path was broken then the call would be lost. The US feared a nuclear attack that damaged the telephone system and they would not be able to launch a counter attack. To assure retaliation, they wanted an indestructible network and they hired Paul Baran. His idea was to make a ‘hot potato routing; that would be transmitted even if parts of the network was destroyed. Baran chopped each message into small equal sized pieces called packets “to” and “from” addresses.

            In 1969, there was a new innovation called “time sharing.” Before time sharing, they had to punch cards with questions on them and would have to wait until the next day. Time sharing allowed people to type their questions and would receive their answers in two seconds. Bob Taylor, ARPA, needed a separate terminal to log each several time share computers. He knew that one terminal would suffice if all the computers were in a common network. He was allocated one million dollars to turn computer networks into a reality. His idea was to build mini computers to form a network and tie each time shared computer to each one so they are connected. He hired Larry Roberts, first person to connect two computers, and he found engineers who would build Taylor’s network idea (ARPANET). The mini computers were called IMPs (Interface Message Processor). Their plan was to attach them to identical imps in four different places, three in California and one in Utah. By 1969, all four sites were connected successfully. By 1971, however, the ARPANET haf 18 different computers connected to the network.

            New innovations called LANs (local area network) linked computers throughout offices and WENs (wide area network) linked computers across buildings or campuses. The problem however was that each network “spoke its own language.” In 1973, Ben Cerf and Bob Kahn teamed up to develop procedures called TCP/IP protocol. This enabled networks to interconnect and was later adopted as the universal standard.

            On June 9th 1992 Congress passed a bill taking the internet out of the exclusive hands of the government and into the public. The problem that the early internet had was finding the information people wanted. Physicist Tim Berners-Lee developed a software to follow threads of knowledge within the information throughout the internet more easily and called it the “World WIde Web.” Later, a user-friendly software to browse the world wide web was created by Marc Andreessen  called Mosaic and later, Netscape. After this, the web grew by 341 thousand percent and the rest is history.
